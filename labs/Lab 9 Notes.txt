The idea behind dynamic allocation is that we want to be able to allocate memory on a needed basis as opposed to assigning an arbitrarily large amount of memory that may or may not ever be used.

Stacks store the local variables and such that are initialised at runtime

Dynamic memory allocation occurs in the heaps, which then can be used by programs. The program can free the memory allocated in the heap if it does not need it.
