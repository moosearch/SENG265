STUFF IN REGEX (Using the 're' module)

Specific formats in string
    a{100} - 100 'a'
    
    [abc] - check for a, b, or c
    
    \d - digit format (numbers between 1 and 9)
    \D - complement of \d
    
    \w - zero to 9, a to z, no other symbols
    \W - complement of \W    
    
    \s - whitespace
    
    \b - word boundry

    ^ - anchor at beginning
    $ - anchor at the end

Example of \b
    You have the string "Chris Christmas"
    
    using "Chris\b" would return "Chris
    using "Chris" would return "Chris" and "Christmas"


re module
    
    re.match() always matches the things starting from the beginning only (equivalent to using ^ in search)
    re.search() only finds the first instance of whatever you're matching anywhere in the string
    re.findall finds all instances of the result you are looking for
    Both methods above return match objects
    
Match Objects
    Match is a class in python
    
    .start is finding first instance of the start
    .end is ending first instance of the end
    
Groups
    say you have
    
        str = "250 123 4567"
    
Raw string literal
    
    rstr = r"\n"
    
    the string above will not read that as a 'newline' but rather simply and literally "\n"
    
Compile the pattern expression, p, by

    co = re.compile(p)
    
    Then you can use co instead of the pattern
    
    co.search(str) <-> re.search(p, str)
    
    This will save time in program execution
